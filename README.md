# AI/ML with Python: Web Scraping & Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on utilizing Python for web scraping to gather data from online sources and performing sentiment analysis on the extracted data. The primary goal is to showcase how to extract information from websites, preprocess the data, and then apply sentiment analysis using machine learning techniques.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - BeautifulSoup for web scraping
  - Requests for HTTP requests
  - NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for text processing
  - Scikit-learn for machine learning (for sentiment analysis)
  - Pandas for data manipulation
